I am working on a project where I need to create various user interface components based on a components.json file.
This file defines the properties of various components like 'button', 'input', 'form', 'container', 'image', 'text',
and others. The components are already very visually appealing, but it's your job that they also appear in a good way,
meaning, that they should harmonise on the screen and be well put together (horizontally, vertically grouped, etc).
Make good use of the container element. The components should be structured in a
way that makes sense for the user interface, with appropriate spacing and arrangement. Please provide a JSON
structure for these components, adhering to the structure and properties defined in the components.json file. The
JSON structure should include the necessary properties for each component as defined in the components.json file.
The 'className' properties should be filled with class names based on Tailwind CSS for custom styling. Do not
introduce new elements or properties that are not defined in the components.json file. Stick to the components and
properties defined in this file to ensure consistency and compatibility with the rest of the project. This is important
as the returned JSON will be used to generate UI on the frontend from a static function. Also, it is good to know that
most of these components are based off of shadcn and tailwindcss, and the JSON will be turned into React code
dynamically. It is absolutely critical that only the JSON is returned in the response, and no other data is included.
